# Drivers Ed Tracker (for Android)
A simple app allowing the user to track the hours they have driven.
This could be used by anyone who needs to track their drive times,
but is particularly intended for those preparing for their drivers'
tests.

This app was developed by a bunch of folks at Centric Consulting who
are learning Android.

An iOS version is also underway.
